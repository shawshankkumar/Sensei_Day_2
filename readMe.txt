# Sensei Day 2

Hi there. Welcome to day 2 or sensei. Or rather the repo of the code I wrote for the day 2. 
Sensei is an event hosted by AlexaDevSrm and I was fortunate enough to be a speaker. I took a session where I went over the basics of Node.js and express and build a very basic API and demonstrated how http requests work. Wrote some code and made some memes.
